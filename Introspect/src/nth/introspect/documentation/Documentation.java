/**
 * The Introspect manual is generated from the Javadoc. This gives the following advantages:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The documentation is in-line with the code</li>
 * <li>The documentation can be read from the code base</li>
 * <li>The IDE is used as an editor (with spelling checker and text completion)</li>
 * <li>Basic HTML features can be used</li>
 * <li>References to other code can be used (which is updated during refactoring)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The Introspect manual uses the JavaDoc int the Introspect projects that
 * describes the classes, but also needs additional information. This is done
 * with empty interfaces that contain javadoc that explain a certain subject.
 * These interfaces should extend this interface so that their purpose is clear.
