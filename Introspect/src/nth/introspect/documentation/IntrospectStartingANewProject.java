/**
 * <p>How you create a new Introspect application depends on the type of application type that you want to create.</p>
 * <p>First select the type of application you want to create. Then look up the corresponding paragraph in the {@link IntrospectGettingStarted} chapter. There you will learn how to create a java project that contains an application class that extends the {@link IntrospectApplication} class. This class will initialize and start the {@link IntrospectFramework}. This class also contains methods that you need to implement to provide the {@link ServiceObject} classes and {@link InfrastructureLayer} classes that are required in the application.</p>
